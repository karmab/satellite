satellite
=========

satellite.py script to interact with a satellite5.X/spacewalk server
can list machines,software and configuration channels,schedules file deployment and command execution, view last command executed, retrieves and uploads configuration files,...
needs a .satelliterc (will possibly be changed to satellite.ini or something like that in the future) to define credentials (and also custominfo that you want to be retrieved when running satellite.py -m)
